Firmware is a special class of software that is responsible for controlling hardware. It is not stored in hard drives or SSDs like regular software, *itâ€™s etched into the device itself* (found on memory chips on the device) when it gets manufactured.

[[Knowledge/Engineering/Operating Systems/BIOS|BIOS]] and [[Knowledge/Engineering/Operating Systems/UEFI|UEFI]] are examples of firmware.
