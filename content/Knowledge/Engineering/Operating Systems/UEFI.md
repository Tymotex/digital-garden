TODO.

**UEFI** (unified extensible firmware interface)

UEFI is basically a better version of [[Knowledge/Engineering/Operating Systems/BIOS|BIOS]]. See [[Knowledge/Engineering/Operating Systems/BIOS|BIOS]] for more details about the purpose of UEFI.
- Almost all newer motherboards ship with UEFI instead of BIOS.
- UEFI has a nicer GUI for users to change boot and hardware settings. It also supports mouse usage (where previously BIOS didn't).
