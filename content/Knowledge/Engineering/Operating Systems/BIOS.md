**BIOS** (*Basic Input/Output System*) is the [[Knowledge/Engineering/Operating Systems/Firmware|firmware]] thatâ€™s loaded onto a ROM chip (usually EPROM, erasable programmable read-only memory, which lets the manufacturer push updates to you) on the [[Areas/Battlestation/Motherboard|Motherboard]].
- BIOS is *the first thing the machine runs* when you turn on the power.
- The BIOS locates from disk, bootstraps and starts the [[Knowledge/Engineering/Operating Systems/Boot Loader|Boot Loader]] which loads the kernel into memory.
- BIOS drivers give you very basic control over computer hardware.
- BIOS gives you a GUI for configuring hardware settings.
- BIOS runs the [[Knowledge/Engineering/Operating Systems/POST Test|POST Test]] on machine startup.
- The BIOS on different motherboards are likely implemented differently.

See [[Knowledge/Engineering/Operating Systems/UEFI|UEFI]], which is basically the newer and better alternative to BIOS that ships with most new motherboards.
