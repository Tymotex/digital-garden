title: Estate Tax
---

A.k.a. *inheritance tax*, *death tax*. It's a tax that must be paid when your *estate* is transferred to a recipient by a *will* upon your death.
- Your estate is the sum of the assets you leave behind when you die.

The U.S. has thresholds which if you're below your estate recipients will be exempt from tax.
