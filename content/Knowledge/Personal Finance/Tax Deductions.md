*Tax deductions* are expenses related to income generation that you can claim to reduce your tax. To claim something as work-related, you have to be able to prove that itâ€™s helped you earn income. You must keep your purchase receipts around for 5 years after the claim (you can manage it in the ATO app's [myDeductions](https://ato.gov.au/mydeductions) tool).
