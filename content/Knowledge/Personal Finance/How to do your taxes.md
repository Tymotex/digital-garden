	- If you get [[Knowledge/Personal Finance/Restricted Stock Units|Restricted Stock Units]] as part of compensation, that requires special treatment.
1. Figure out all the things you want to claim [[Knowledge/Personal Finance/Tax Deductions|Tax Deductions]] on.
2. Navigate to https://onlineservices.ato.gov.au/ and use their online form to lodge a tax return. Many things will likely be prefilled by your employer.
