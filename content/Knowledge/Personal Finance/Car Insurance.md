**Types of coverage:**
- Compulsory third party (CTP) insurance. Also called **Green Slip**.
	- Covers injuries of the affected parties due to motor accidents.
	- It's compulsory by law. You can't drive without this.
- Third party property insurance — covers damage to cars you hit.
    - May be the best option if your car isn’t worth much and isn’t too important.
- Fire and theft insurance — covers fire and theft specifically.
- Comprehensive insurance — covers:
    - Your car’s damages.
    - All of the above (fire, theft, their car's damages, etc.)

**Notes**:
- You can either decide to be compensated with ‘agreed value’ or ‘market value’.
    - Agreed value — “pay me a fixed price” (at a slightly higher premium)
    - Market value — “pay me based on whatever my car is worth at the incident’s time”
- Some policies give you free roadside assistance if you’re stranded as a result of a car breakdown.
- Often, you must make a claim within X days of an accident before it’s considered too late.

- Your premium is essentially a measure of the likelihood you’ll file a claim.
- “Exclusions” refers to things you’re not covered for. Typical exclusions include damage caused when you’re driving under influence, vandalism, weather-related damages, etc.
- You may have to pay an excess even when you’re not at fault. Some insurance policies won’t do this though.
- An ‘underwriter’ is the person/entity who calculates the risks behind an insurance policy for an insurance company.

**Tips**:
- Ask your insurer if they can give you discounts, such as for installing an alarm on your car.
- Always take the largest excess possible.
- If given the option, consider electing to choose your own repairer. It costs more but you have more control.
