You can get Qantas points through [[Knowledge/Personal Finance/Credit Cards#Credit Card Churning|credit card churning]].

Qantas points can be used with a bunch of partner airlines, not just Qantas.

Based on some [Redditor's analysis in 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/QantasFrequentFlyer/comments/10vqljl/what_is_a_qantas_point_worth/), 1 point exchanging for 3 cents or greater is considered good value.

General points:
- Redeeming is apparently hard.
- Best value achieved when booking better-than-economy classes.
