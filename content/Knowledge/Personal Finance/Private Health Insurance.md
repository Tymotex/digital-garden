title: Private Health Insurance
---

All the notes here are in the context of Australia. See [[Knowledge/Personal Finance/Medicare|Medicare]], Australia's public healthcare system. It already covers doctor visits and a bunch of other things. The purpose of getting private health insurance is to get access to specific services and doctors not publicly funded by the government. See [[Knowledge/Personal Finance/Medicare#Medicare vs. Private Health Insurance|Medicare vs. Private health insurance]].

Some basic things to know:
- Anyone can buy private health insurance. 
- When you buy insurance, there are some services you can't immediately use. There may be a waiting period before you can get coverage for those services (this prevents people from exploiting insurance).
- The insurer, by law, cannot charge someone extra for being high risk. They can, however, extend your waiting period for pre-existing illnesses.
