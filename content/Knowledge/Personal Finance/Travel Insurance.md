Types of coverage:

- Trip interruption.
- Flight change.
- Baggage (lost, stolen, delayed).
- Rental car.
- Delay.
- Emergency medical and evacuation.
- Death and dismemberment
- Comprehensive (covers all the above).

You can leave buying travel insurance to right before your trip, though if you are wanting coverage for trip cancellation, then you're best off buying right as you buy your flights.

Notes:

Typically, travel insurance costs around 5-15% of the total trip cost. Factors affecting travel insurance price:
