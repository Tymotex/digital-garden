## Hanging Leg Raise
This is mainly a hip flexor and abdominals exercise.

Notes:
- There should be quite a bit of lumbar flexion (i.e. curving your lower spine). You should be doing a 'hanging ab curl', tilting the pelvis up as the legs raise. 
	- Cue: show your ass to someone directly in front of you.
- Stop rocking and using momentum. Go up and down slowly.
- Prefer going at least perpendicular. 
	- You can raise your legs all the way up to the bar for more abdominal engagement. 
	- A reason to not go too high: the legs are meant to be resistance for the abs. When you go all the way, you're no longer working your abs much at the top.
