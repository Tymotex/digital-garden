## Plant-Based Oils
It's important to keep all plant-based oils in a dark and cool place to prevent it becoming rancid. This has consequences to taste, but most importantly your health.

To keep it simple, cook only with high smoke point oils like avocado oil. Use EVOO where high temperature is not involved, especially EVOO sourced from particular regions of the world like Italy or California.

With regards to taste, some oils will apply greater flavour to what youâ€™re cooking. E.g. Canola oil barely has any effect whereas peanut oil gives a signature nutty taste to Thai dishes.

### Stop Eating Seed Oils

There is a general health trend to avoid certain seed oils. Why?
- They're highly processed. It doesn't mean it's inherently bad, but you should now be skeptical.
	- Usually, extra virgin olive oil, sesame seed oil, avocado oil are all made from a simple procedure that just involves pressing the fruit/seed for its oil.
	- Other seed oils like grapeseed oil require intense heat and chemical treatment to make the oil edible. In the process, antioxidants are stripped away and destroyed.
	- Trans fats may be produced that stay in the oil.
- Linoleic acid is particularly bad. The oils with highest concentrations in this are: grapeseed oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, soybean (vegetable) oil, etc.
	- Research links this to inflammation and oxidative stress.
	- There's an imbalance of [[Fats|omega-6 to omega-3]] fatty acids.
	- Animal fat (like lard or duck fat) may be high in linoleic acid too because of the animal's high soy or corn diet.

The best oils are probably:
- Avocado oil.
- Certified extra-virgin olive oil.
	- This was a staple in Mediterranean diets, historically.
- Macadamia oil.
- Beef tallow.
- Coconut oil.
