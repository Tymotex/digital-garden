> Supplementation is an are where it makes sense to eb extremely skeptical in judgement. Thoughtless supplementation is at best wasteful and at worst damaging to health.

These are the main things people have supplements of:
- Vitamins.
- Minerals.
- Digestive enzymes.
- Probiotics.
- Prebiotics. 
- Antioxidants.
- Folate.
- Fish oil.
    - If you already eat fish twice a week, this probably has no effect.
- Fiber.
    - Consider psyllium which can reduce cholesterol.
- Adaptogens.

**The expensive pee problem**: overconsuming certain things will be wasteful because the excess will be excreted. Should only consume if known to be deficient. Fat soluble vitamins may accumulate, apparently, to toxic levels of overconsumed.

> Supplements may work badly with prescription medication. Always inform your doctor about what you're taking.

## Vitamins
**Nutrient absorption caveat**: you should consume fat soluble vitamin supplements with fatty foods like peanut butter to maximise absorption.

### Vitamin D
No amount of UV exposure is safe. Despite this, sun exposure does have important health benefits that you cannot substitute away from â€” it plays a massive role in regulating your circadian rhythm and vitamin D production.
	
You can supplement Vitamin d3.

It's a fat soluble vitamin, so eat it with fatty foods.

> There is no way to know whether supplements like this are effective without a blood test.

## Minerals
TODO.
Magnesium is great apparently.

## Probiotics
- Probiotics are living microbes that are considered good. Microbiota exists all along mucus lining and other surfaces in your body. You exchange bacteria even through handshakes
- Diversity of microbiota is very good.
- Excellent sources of microbes are low sugar fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, greek yoghurt, Kombucha. Studies show that eating 4 servings a day greatly enhances gut microbiome and reduces inflammation.

## Prebiotics
- Prebiotics are food sources of good microbes.

## Antioxidants
In general, antioxidant supplementation has turned up very disappointing results in studies. Vitamin A, C, beta carotene supplements for example have shown to have no effect and have been linked to increased cancer risk, not reduced.

## Sleep Supplements

TODO.
- Myo-inositol.
- Magnesium L-Threonate for speeding up the transition to sleep.
- Apigenin, sourced from chamomile, which reduces anxiety.
- Melatonin. Huberman is not a fan.
- Theanine.

## Ashwagandha Root
TODO. Could take these as powder.

Has a potent stress reduction effect.

## Maca Root
TODO.

Useful for libido.

## Alpha-GPC
TODO.

Apparently useful for focus?
