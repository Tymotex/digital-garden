title: Tim's Dev Wiki
---

Hi! I'm Tim, a software engineer at Google and computer science graduate from the University of New South Wales.

Welcome to my personal developer wiki. Learning is chaotic ‚Äî this is my attempt to establish some semblance of order in my haphazard efforts to piece together a better understanding of the world. This wiki contains things I learn about software engineering, science, investing, economics, and a bunch of other random areas of study.

üå≤ These are my [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). They're a constant work in progress ‚Äî I'm pruning, editing and adding new notes as I piece together a better understanding of software engineering as well as other areas of study that interest me.

üó∫Ô∏è Hit `ctrl+k` to fuzzy search through the entire wiki.

üë®‚Äçüíª Who am I? See [timz.dev](https://timz.dev).
